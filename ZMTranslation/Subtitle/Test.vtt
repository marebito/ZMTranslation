00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.127
In this video, we're gonna write our
first line of code in Visual Studio.

2
00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:12.824
That's going to be print Hello World,
and then when we go into Unity and

3
00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:17.459
click play, in the console area of Unity,
it will print Hello World.

4
00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:21.788
This is a small but very significant step
in making sure that our environment is set

5
00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:26.270
up correctly, and Unity and Visual Studio
are working correctly together.

6
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.850
Let's start by talking
briefly about how Unity and

7
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.880
Visual Studio relate to one another.

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.800
So Unity is our game engine.

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.450
This is where we say what
the behaviors are in our game, and

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.620
how all the pieces relate to one another.

11
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.430
And how it all looks and
how it all shapes up and comes together.

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.060
One of the pieces that we
use in Unity is our code,

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.350
and our code is written in
files that are .cs files.

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.975
These are also called scripts, and
they're a bunch of texts that say what

15
00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:57.095
are the rules and behaviors of the things
that we want to have happen in our game.

16
00:00:57.095 --> 00:01:00.895
And the place that we write these
scripts is in Visual Studio.

17
00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:05.640
Visual Studio is an IDE, that's
an Integrated Developer Environment.

18
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.560
And it gives us a whole lot of structure
and tools to make our life easier, and

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.500
to avoid making mistakes.

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.267
So if you're a Mac user, this is a good
time to point out that there's really not

21
00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:20.051
a lot of differences between Mac and PC
when it comes to Unity and Visual Studio.

22
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:23.612
But in the next video,
Ben is gonna through those differences, so

23
00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:27.173
it's really clear what you're
looking at and how it relates, and

24
00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:29.799
how it differs from what
we're seeing on the PC.

25
00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.352
So let's go ahead and
create our first scripts, and

26
00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:37.500
use Visual Studio to make
a little bit of magic in Unity.

27
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.620
So let's open up Unity Hub, few after you
downloaded it, it might have a shortcut

28
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.870
on your desktop, or you might need to
navigate to it through your Program menu.

29
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.940
When you open that up, you can see
I've got a bunch of projects in here.

30
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.970
If this is the first time you are using
Hub, then yours is probably empty.

31
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.430
And you wanna make sure that,

32
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.930
under Installs, you got 2018 or
later ready to go.

33
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.750
So, from any of these tabs up hear,
click on New.

34
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.980
And that will allow us
to create a new project,

35
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.290
and it's gonna ask us where
we want to save that.

36
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.520
Let me just show you my directory here.

37
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.180
I put that and then we can see
exactly what's going on in here.

38
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.450
So for me, I've created under my D drive.

39
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.840
So just any of your drives.

40
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.000
I've got a D drive here, I've created
a photo called Repos which is short for

41
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.550
the terminology repositories,
which is something

42
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.080
that'll be relevant later on in the course
when we look at source control.

43
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.740
And then within Repos,
I've created Unity2D,

44
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.650
which is where all of the projects
from this course are going to go,

45
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.170
and the first section we're
working on isIntro_Setup.

46
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.870
So, I encourage you to
do a similar structure,

47
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.705
have a Repos directory
with our Unity2D course,

48
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:48.584
and then for this particular section it's
intro and setup, ready and running this.

49
00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:51.226
So when we go into start our new project,

50
00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:55.812
we click on the three little dots to
the right of location, down here,

51
00:02:55.812 --> 00:03:00.710
and that will allow us to go and
choose where we want to set that up.

52
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.881
Go to DATA, or DATA, depending
from where you're from, Repos, and

53
00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:07.370
then Unity2D, and then Intro_Setup.

54
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.348
So I'
